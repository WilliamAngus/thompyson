# TODO

## Tree Pairs

- Ability to "call" them; i.e., make them into functions.
- Ability to convert into TeX/TikZ.
- Ability to pre-multiply an element of F by a rotation efficiently. -- Implementation

## Breakpoints

- Change `breaks_to_tree_pair` to take another `Dyadic` which specifies the value of the function at 0 in order to stop all rotations being treated like the identity in T, when no breaks are given.

## Plotting

Add the ability to plot the following things
- Breaks
- Tree Pairs

Similarly, allow graphical representation of a tree pair as a tree.

## Dyadics

Implement the following:
- division (`__div__`, `__idiv__`, `__rdiv__`) -- this will usually return a `Rational`
- powers -- returns a `Rational` usually if we need to take the inverse first.

## Rationals

- add
- radd
- iadd
- mul
- rmul
- imul
- sub
- rsub
- isub
- eq
- lt
- le
- gt
- ge
- repr
- div
- idiv
- rdiv
- pow

## Documentation

- Add documentation in the text everywhere.
- Improve the README's readability.
- Add a website for documentation, using something like `sphinx`.

## Future Work

- Mather Invariant
- Getting orbits of points
- Getting fixed points
- Normal forms
- Lengths
